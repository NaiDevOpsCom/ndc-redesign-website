# Dependency & Supply Chain Security

## Overview

Modern web applications rely on hundreds or thousands of third-party dependencies. **Supply Chain Security** is the practice of ensuring that these dependencies are legitimate, up-to-date, and free from known vulnerabilities.

A compromised package in our `package.json` could lead to data exfiltration, backdoors in our build process, or the injection of malicious scripts into the final production bundle.

## Why This Matters

### The Threat Model

1. **Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)**: Older versions of packages often have documented security flaws that attackers can exploit easily.
2. **Malicious Package Injection**: Attackers may attempt to compromise a maintainer's account or use "typosquatting" to trick developers into installing a malicious twin of a popular package.
3. **Automated Exploitation**: Attackers constantly scan public repositories for applications using vulnerable versions of common libraries like `lodash` or `express`.

If this was not implemented, our application would inevitably accumulate "security debt," making it an easier target for automated attacks and increasing the risk of a serious data breach.

## Implementation Details

We use **GitHub Dependabot** to automate our dependency management. Dependabot acts as a tireless security researcher that monitors our `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

### Key Configuration Decisions

- **Daily Monitoring**: We check for updates every morning (`09:00 Africa/Nairobi`) to ensure we are alerted to zero-day vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
- **Dependency Grouping**: To maintain a stable build, we group related packages (e.g., `react` and `@types/react`) so they are updated together, reducing the risk of version mismatch errors.
- **PR Limit**: We limit the number of open Dependabot Pull Requests to `10` to prevent "alert fatigue" and ensure that each security update is reviewed carefully.
- **Designated Reviewers**: All security PRs are automatically assigned to senior developers for immediate review.

## Code & Configuration Location

The Dependabot configuration is located at:
**[`.github/dependabot.yml`](../../.github/dependabot.yml)**

### Relevant Sections Explained

- `package-ecosystem: "npm"`: Monitors our JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies.
- `interval: "daily"`: The frequency of security checks.
- `groups`: Logical groupings developed to ensure that core React and toolchain components remain in sync during updates.
- `ignore`: Configuration to skip specific version ranges (e.g., blocking major version upgrades that contain breaking changes until the team is ready).

## Security Benefits

- **Reduced Attack Surface**: By staying on the latest versions, we close known security holes before they can be exploited.
- **Automated Alerts**: Immediate notification if a package in our current lockfile is flagged as vulnerable.
- **Confidence in Compliance**: Ensures that the project adheres to standard security compliance requirements for dependency management.

## Limitations & Trade-offs

- **"Upgrade Noise"**: Updating frequently can occasionally introduce regressions if package maintainers break semantic versioning.
- **Manual Review Required**: Dependabot can open the PR, but it cannot (and should not) automatically merge it. Human review of the changelog and build status is still essential.
- **Zero-Day Lag**: There is always a small window between a vulnerability being discovered and it being reported to official databases.

## Maintenance & Future Improvements

- **Changelog Review**: Developers MUST read the linked changelogs in Dependabot PRs to check for security-related fixes vs. feature updates.
- **Audit Scripts**: We run `npm audit` locally and in CI to provide a second layer of verification.
- **Lockfile Integrity**: Ensure that `package-lock.json` is always committed to the repository to prevent "dependency drift."
