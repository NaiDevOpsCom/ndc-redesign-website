Welcome to the Nairobi DevOps Community (NDC) Security Documentation. This directory contains detailed information regarding our security architecture, defensive measures, and maintenance procedures.

## Security Mission Statement

The mission of the Nairobi DevOps Community is to build and maintain a secure, transparent, and resilient digital platform. We believe that security is a core feature of any high-quality application and should be integrated into every stage of the development lifecycle.

## Developer Quick Start

If you are a developer contributing to this project, please ensure you follow these security guidelines:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Review and merge Dependabot PRs promptly.
2. **Review CSP for New Services**: If you add a new external API or tracking script, update [`vercel.json`](../../vercel.json).
3. **Use Safe Navigation**: Never use `window.location` directly with user input; always use the `safeNavigate` utility.
4. **Secrets Management**: Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository. Use environment variables.
