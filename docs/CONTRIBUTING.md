## Access & Workflow

This is an internal project. Contributors are typically invited team members, but we welcome requests from the community to join the effort.

### Forking vs Branching

**Internal Contributors**

- Create branches directly from the main repository.

**External Contributors**

1.  Before starting work, **open an issue** or comment on an existing issue describing your proposed contribution.
2.  Tag or mention the maintainers to request approval or guidance.
3.  Once approved and added as a contributor, **clone the repository**.
4.  Work on your local clone following this guide.
5.  Open Pull Requests (PRs) back to the main repository.

---

## Project Setup

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

Follow these steps to get your development environment ready:

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ndc-redesign-website
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Use `npm ci` to install dependencies based on the `package-lock.json` file. This ensures a consistent and reliable setup that matches our CI environment.

    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3.  **Run the Development Server**
    This command starts the Vite development server with hot-reloading.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use a branching model based on `main` and `pre-dev` (staging) branches:

| Branch               | Role        | Description                                                                                                       |
| :------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`main`**           | Production  | The stable, live version of the application. Direct pushes are disabled. All changes come from `pre-dev`.         |
| **`pre-dev`**        | Staging     | The primary integration branch. All new features, bug fixes, and chores are merged here first for testing and QA. |
| **Feature Branches** | Development | Short-lived branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`) created from `pre-dev` for all development work.               |

### Contribution Steps

1.  **Sync with `pre-dev`**: Before starting, make sure your local `pre-dev` branch is up-to-date.

    ```bash
    git checkout pre-dev
    git pull origin pre-dev
    ```

2.  **Create a New Branch**: Create a descriptive branch name from `pre-dev` using our naming convention.

    **Format**: `<type>/<short-description>`

    **Allowed Types**:
    - `feature` – New functionality
    - `bugfix` – Non-urgent bug fixes
    - `hotfix` – Urgent production fixes
    - `docs` – Documentation only
    - `chore` – Tooling, dependencies, configuration

    **Examples**:

    ```bash
    # Feature
    git checkout -b feature/user-profile-card

    # Bugfix
    git checkout -b bugfix/navbar-mobile-overflow

    # Hotfix
    git checkout -b hotfix/login-crash-prod

    # Documentation
    git checkout -b docs/contributing-guide

    # Chore
    git checkout -b chore/update-eslint-config
    ```

3.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code, following the project's existing style and conventions.

4.  **Run Local Checks**: Before committing, ensure your changes pass all local quality checks.

    ```bash
    npm run format # Format code with Prettier
    npm run lint   # Check for code quality issues with ESLint
    npm run test   # Run automated tests with Vitest
    ```

5.  **Commit Your Changes**: We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. See [Commit Message Convention](#commit-message-convention) for details.

    ```bash
    # Example commit
    git commit -m "feat(auth): add password reset functionality"
    ```

6.  **Push Your Branch**:

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/user-profile-card
    ```

7.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the `pre-dev` branch.

## Code Quality and Standards

### Linting and Formatting

- **Prettier**: We use Prettier for consistent code formatting. Run `npm run format` to format your code automatically.
- **ESLint**: We use ESLint to catch potential bugs, security issues, and enforce best practices. Run `npm run lint` to check your code.

**Key Linting Rules:**
- **Security**: Plugins like `eslint-plugin-security` help prevent vulnerabilities (e.g., object injection, `no-eval`).
- **React Hooks**: We strictly enforce `rules-of-hooks` and `exhaustive-deps` to prevent bugs in component lifecycles.
- **Imports**: `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` ensures a clean codebase by stripping unused imports.
- **Best Practices**: Stricter rules are in place. Address warnings (e.g., regarding impure functions) rather than suppressing them.

### Testing

- **Vitest**: The project uses Vitest for unit and integration tests. Run `npm run test` to execute the test suite. All new features should include corresponding tests.

### Commit Message Convention

This repository follows the **Conventional Commits** specification to support readable history and automated tooling.

**Format**

```
<type>(optional-scope): short description
```

**Allowed Types**

- `feat` – New feature
- `fix` – Bug fix
- `docs` – Documentation
- `chore` – Maintenance or tooling
- `refactor` – Code changes without behavior change
- `test` – Test-only changes

**Examples**

```
feat(auth): add remember-me option
fix(navbar): resolve mobile overflow
chore(deps): bump react-query version
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

### The PR Process

1.  **Target the `pre-dev` Branch**: Ensure your Pull Request (PR) is targeting the `pre-dev` branch.
2.  **Provide a Clear Description**: Fill out the PR template with a clear title and a detailed description of the changes.
3.  **Pass CI Checks**: Automated checks (Qodana, Dependency Review, Build Verification) must pass before merging.

### Required CI Checks

- **Qodana Code Quality**: Static analysis for bugs and security.
- **Dependency Review**: Scans for vulnerable dependencies.
- **Hardened Build Verification**: Ensures production readiness (no source maps, no console logs).
- **Lint/Test/Build**: Verifies code integrity.

### Code Review

- Maintainers will review your PR.
- Address any feedback and resolve conversations.
- Once approved, your PR will be merged into `pre-dev`.
