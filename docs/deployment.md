# Deployment Documentation

This document describes the deployment implementation for the NDC Redesign Website.

## Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD, deploying to a cPanel-hosted server via SSH and RSync. The deployment process is designed to be **atomic**, ensuring zero downtime and easy rollbacks.

## Deployment Workflow

The workflow is defined in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

### Triggers

1.  **Push to `main`**: Automatically triggers a deployment when changes are merged into the main branch. The workflow monitors the following paths:
    - `client/src/**`
    - `client/public/**`
    - `package.json`
    - `package-lock.json`
    - `vite.config.ts`
    - `tsconfig.json`
    - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2.  **Manual Trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)**: Allows manual execution of the workflow from the GitHub "Actions" tab for any branch.

### Prerequisites (GitHub Secrets)

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository:

- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private SSH key for server access (OpenSSH format).
- `KNOWN_HOSTS`: SSH known hosts for identity verification (use `ssh-keyscan` to obtain this).
- `REMOTE_HOST`: Server IP or hostname.
- `REMOTE_USER`: SSH username.
- `REMOTE_PORT`: SSH port (defaults to 22).
- `REMOTE_PATH`: The final path where the website should be accessible (e.g., `/home/user/public_html`).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Build Process

The build process runs on `ubuntu-latest`:

- Installs dependencies using `npm ci`.
- Generates security headers via `npm run security:generate`.
- Builds the production assets using `npm run build`.
- Validates that the `dist` directory is not empty.

### 2. Atomic Deployment Mechanism

Instead of overwriting the existing site, the workflow uses a release-based structure for true atomic updates:

1.  **Timestamp Generation**: A unique timestamp (`RELEASE_TIMESTAMP`) is created for each deployment.
2.  **Release Directory**: A new directory is created on the server: `/home/${user}/releases/${timestamp}`.
3.  **Sync**: Files from the `dist` directory are synced to the new release directory using `rsync`.
4.  **Atomic Symlink Switch**: The workflow uses a "Create-and-Move" pattern to ensure atomicity and compatibility with cPanel:
    - A temporary symlink is created pointing to the new release.
    - The `mv -Tf` command atomically replaces the current `REMOTE_PATH` with the new symlink.
    - Ownership is explicitly set to the remote user to comply with cPanel security policies (e.g., SecureLinks).

### 3. Supply-Chain Security

- **Pinned Actions**: All GitHub Actions are pinned to full commit SHAs (e.g., `appleboy/ssh-action@7eaf766...`) rather than mutable version tags. This prevents "tag retargeting" attacks and ensures the exact same code runs every time.
- **Safe Secret Handling**: Multi-line secrets like `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` and `KNOWN_HOSTS` are written using `printf` to avoid interpretation of special characters.

### 4. Verification & Rollback

- **Verification**: After deployment, check the website URL to ensure the new changes are live.
- **Rollback**: To roll back to a previous version, manually update the symlink on the server:
  ```bash
  ln -sfn /home/user/releases/OLD_TIMESTAMP /home/user/public_html.tmp
  mv -Tf /home/user/public_html.tmp /home/user/public_html
  ```

## Testing Your Deployment

Before merging to `main`, you can test your deployment workflow using one of these methods:

### Manual Dispatch (Recommended)

1.  Push your feature branch to GitHub.
2.  Go to **Actions** -> **Deploy to cPanel**.
3.  Click **Run workflow**, select your branch, and click **Run workflow**.

### Local Testing with `act`

If you have Docker installed, you can test the workflow locally:

```bash
act --secret-file .secrets
```

_(Make sure `.secrets` contains values for all required GitHub Secrets)_

> [!TIP]
> Always verify that your build passes locally with `npm run build` before pushing to GitHub.
