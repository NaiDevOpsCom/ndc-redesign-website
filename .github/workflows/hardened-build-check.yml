# This workflow verifies the integrity and security of the build artifacts.
# It ensures that:
# 1. The application builds successfully (including TypeScript validation via the build script).
# 2. No source maps are generated (preventing source code leakage).
# 3. No console.log or debugger statements remain in the production build.
